			<p>After a late start we spent some time exploring the area around Asheville.
			Included in these explorations was a drive to the town of Chimney Rock,
			a quaint little one street town at the foot of a spectacular granite
			tower called, you guessed it Chimney Rock. Unfortunately we could not tour the top
			of the rock as the <em>elevator</em> is being replaced and will be out of action for
			a year, and the track was closed until mid April.</p>
			<?php JournalGalleryShow() ;?>
			<p>The remainder of the day was spent traveling along the Blue Ridge Parkway, an interesting and
			pretty drive. The forest is still in winter mode with almost no leaves on the trees, and a thick
			carpet of leaves on the floor of the forest. The only departures from this winter scene
			were the abundant stands of Rhododendrons with their green leaves all pointing towards the ground, 
			and the frequent dogwood trees that were in bloom everywhere. This would be an interesting trip
			later in the year when the foliage is in full growth.</p>
