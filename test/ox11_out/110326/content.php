		<p>Boy did we get our weather predictions wrong for this trip. Another
			cold night with a light dusting of fresh snow this morning. However the sun
			was out and the sky blue. Really a pretty morning. We took advantage of
			the pleasant campground and lazed around until late morning before getting underway. </p>
			<p>Once under way we proceeded south to Salida and then west along Co 50 through
			Monarch pass, the town of Gunnison and Blue Mesa Reservoir. Much of the way
			the country was still in the grip of winter, and tourists were out enjoying
			winter activities, skiing, snow machines and even dog sledging. The sky was mostly clear
			and the scenery impressive.</p>
