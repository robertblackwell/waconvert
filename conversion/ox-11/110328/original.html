			<p>Before starting the days travel we drove along the rim road of the Canyon de Chelly, stopping at
			a number of the numerous overlooks. The Canyon de Chelly is only 500-600 feet deep, but spectacular,
			with many impressive sandstone structures. From some of the overlooks we had glimpses
			of Anastasi ruins built into the canyon wall. The floor of the canyon
			showed signs of recent agriculture, and habitation as well as a vehicle track that we understood
			is used for guided jeep tours.</p>
			<p>Once underway we traveled west along 264 (a rather meandering route) through Navajo reservation
			territory and towns like Steamboat, Keams Canyon  and Kykotsmovis before joining 64 into the
			Southern entrance of the Grand Canyon.</p>
			<?php JournalGalleryShow() ;?>
			<p>The Grand Canyon was (to us) surprisingly busy with many tourists including a good contingent
			of Europeans and their rental RV's. I guess this is one place in the US where tourist season
			is already underway. It seems that no matter how often one sees the canyon, the adjective
			<em>impressive</em> is still appropriate. </p>
