		<p>We were at Campingworld a little after 8:30 to have new front shocks fitted. I had organized this from
			home a few weeks ago in the hope of facilitating a fast turn around. It was not to be so. We were not finished
			until early afternoon, during the process had discovered that one of our tires was about to disintegrate,
			and the rear brakes both pads and rotors need to be replaced. Back on the highway we further discovered
			that while the shocks were improved there was still a substantial vibration. We will need to replace 
			all 4 tires soon.</p>
			<?php Skin::JournalGalleryThumbnails($trip, $entry); ?><p>We drove a few hours down I-26 to Spartanburg, found another WalMart parking lot and settled in,
			made dinner, talked to the security guards (to ensure we could stay the night) and generally enjoyed the
			warm weather and marveled at the flowering trees (dog woods, and ornamental pear). </p>
			<p>As luck would have it there was a Discount Tire outlet in the same complex as WalMart - I will try them
			tomorrow morning to see if they can supply tires.</p>
