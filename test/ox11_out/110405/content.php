		<p>Yesterday we left the Expo site around 8:00am. The exhibition area and campground were
			not quite deserted but only a few vehicles and people remained giving a bit of a forlorn look,
			particularly when compared to the bustle of the last few days. We arrived in Phoenix late morning
			to visit with our son and his girlfriend. The visit was capped off with a delightful dinner
			at a local brewery/restaraunt.</p>
			<?php Skin::JournalGalleryThumbnails($trip, $entry); ?><p>This morning we were again underway early. We have an appointment in Denver Thursday
			morning and that requires that today we cover about 400 miles. Throughout the day the driving
			was easy and we were presented with a wide range of typical Arizona rock formation including
			two towers that were named, and looked like, Elephants feet.</p>
			<p>Late in the day we crossed into Colorado as the scenery gradually changed from desert
			to mountains. About 5:30 after some searching we found Mancos State Park. </p>

		<h3>Camping</h3>
				<p>Mancos State Park. A small campsite near a dam in amongst pine trees. The weather
				was mild and for the first time in ages we had a campfire. </p>
