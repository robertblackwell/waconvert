		<p>Dear reader (if there are any) - I feel like I must apologize for the current crop of
			journal entries. Since leaving South Carolina we have been traveling towards a destination
			rather than traveling for the sake of seeing and exploring. It is difficult to
			make interesting comments about such travels. For in reality the journey is primarily
			about how many miles one can travel in a day before becoming tired. 
			I hope you find the interlude at OX11 of more interest, but I fear that the remainder of
			the journey back to WA will be more traveling to a destination.</p> 
			<p>So I am sorry!!.</p>
			<p>Having said it once I won't say it again.</p>
			<?php Skin::JournalGalleryThumbnails($trip, $entry); ?><p>Today we were blessed with a variety of Colorado mountain scenery, bright sunshine and moderate
			temperatures.</p>

		<h3>Camping</h3>
				<p>Goldfield RV Park. This is not a place that makes one feel welcome. The first words
				uttered by the receptionist were "what discount cards do you have" and this in a very gruff voice.
				Thereafter we found out that we could get electricity but it is METERED, and there is no sign of the
				advertised picnic table. </p>
