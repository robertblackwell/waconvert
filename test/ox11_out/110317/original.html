			<p>We arrived (by plane) in Columbia, SC last night. The mission: to collect our Tiger
			motor home. </p>
			<p>In January we drove it from our home in Washington state to the Tiger factory in
			South Carolina (that was a cold weather adventure that we neglected to document in this journal)
			where over the last 6 weeks the Provan team has been renovating our beloved vehicle. </p>
			<?php JournalGalleryShow() ;?>
			<p>The weather this morning was the first pleasant surprise of the day, warm and sunny with
			the dog woods just showing their blooms. A big change from what we left behind in WA.</p>
			<p>At the factory, the guys were applying some last minute touches to their work. The vehicle
			had only just returned from the paint shop so there were some small things to do - like
			putting on the decorative striping, and some final dabs of silicon sealant. 
			We spent the few hours talking to Robert and the team while they worked (I am sure that helped them!!)</p>
			<p>It took us another hour to unpack the boxes of contents that we had stored at the factory,
			and stow their contents in the vehicle and by mid afternoon we were ready to hit the road.</p>
			<p>The repairs/upgrades/refurbishments to the vehicle are great, and there are many places where
			the guys went beyond the letter of the agreement. New cabinets, new bathroom, new refrigerator, solar panel and 
			controller, vinyl floor, re-stuffed and recovered lounge, new roof, and some body repairs. 
			For all practical purposes the interior of the house is new. We are very pleased with the work and the service.</p>
			<p>After the factory we went and found the local Campingworld where new shocks will be fitted tomorrow
			before heading out along I-20 to have dinner with Jon and Mary - prospective Tiger owners we met through the
			Tiger online user group. </p>
