		<p>It was even colder this morning, 20&deg;F, sunny and clear. We were up and going by 7:00 am
			in order to be at the <a href="http://www.earthroamer.com">Earthroamer</a> factory by mid morning.</p>
			<?php Skin::JournalGalleryThumbnails($trip, $entry); ?><p>Bill Swails, the originator of the Earthroamer vehicles gave us a lengthy tour and explanation of the
			features of these vehicles. Built on Ford F550 pickup trucks these are really hi-tech, high end
			vehicles for people that want to travel to remote places in less than ideal weather conditions.</p>
			<p>It was obvious that the Earthroamer vehicles are more than just "products" to Bill and his enthusiasm 
			is more than a little infectious.</p>
			<p>I won't include details or photos, you can find the latest info on the Earthroamer website. </p>
			<p>From Denver we headed west into the Rockies to discover that winter is definitely not over.</p>
