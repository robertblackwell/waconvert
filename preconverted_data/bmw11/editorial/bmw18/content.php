        <h2 style="text-align:left">Update and foreshadowing.</h2>
	    <p>This site has been pretty quiet for the past year. After Spain and Portugal in 2017 we did a weekend
	    to the North West Mog Fest in 2017 and we have just completed a 3 week tour of the west that included 
		Overland Expo West 2018. But for us, thats quiet.</p>
		
		<p>However starting on June 23rd I (Robert) will be attempting a new style of solo adventure,
		on that date I will be starting a motorcycle ride which I hope will take me to Tuktoyaktuk in Canada's North West Territory
		and Dead Horse, Alaska at the end of the "haul" road. The latest post which accompanies this editorial
		will give some details of my packing and preparation.</p>
		
		<p>By way of reassurance I should note that this solo effort does not signal that there will be no more <em>Nina and Rob</em>
		4 wheel adventures. If all goes according to plan and our health holds out we will be reporting on 3 new 4 wheel adventures over the 
		course of the next 18 months.</p>
		<p>And maybe even another effort on 2 wheel.</p>
