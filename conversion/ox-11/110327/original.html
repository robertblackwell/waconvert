			<p>Our route this morning took us through the town of Ouray and on through Red Mountain 
			and Molas Divide passes to Silverton and Durango.
			We knew from previous visits that this was a spectacular drive and we were not
			disappointed. Though we were a bit surprised, at our selves, when we realized (and observed)
			that Red mountain was still winter white (not red) because of the snow.</p>
			<p>The town of Silverton was quiet with few tourists visible and
			not much action in the main (and only) street.</p>
			<?php JournalGalleryShow() ;?>
			<p>From Durango we turned west to towards Mesa Verde and the town of Cortez. By this time
			the countryside had changed dramatically from mountains and snow to south west desert and
			its huge sandstone structures. By the time we passed into Arizona at Teec Nos Pos the transition from
			alpine to desert was complete. </p>
			<p>We paralleled the Eastern border of Arizona for some miles (along 191) into Navajo
			territory and Canyon De Chelly National Monument.</p>

				<h3>Camping</h3>
				<p>Canyon de Chilly National Monument campground, nice desert campground. The campground
				was open but the toilets were closed. I don't know what tenters were supposed to do??</p>
