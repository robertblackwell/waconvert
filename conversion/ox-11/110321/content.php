		<p>The bare forests and Rhodies continued this morning as we traversed the
			Smokey Mountains. Exiting the tranquil forests and mountains into the excessively and
			garishly developed towns of Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge (which among other things is the 
			home of Dolly Parton, and boasts her Dollywood theme park) and Servierville was a bit of a jolt.</p>
			<?php Skin::JournalGalleryThumbnails($trip, $entry); ?><p>Continuing North West we passed by Knoxville and crossed into Kentucky. The country flatted
			into rolling hills and that famous grass (though I have trouble seeing the blue). Near Lexington we
			detoured through Versailles and passed many obviously expensive/valuable horse farms. Spring seems
			to be a little more advanced in this part of the country. More leaves are visible
			on the roadside trees and the temperature in up into the high 70s. It feels good to be in a T-shirt
			and feeling a warm breeze. </p>
