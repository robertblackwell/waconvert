		<p>We parked on the banks of the Ohio River in downtown Louisville this morning, strolled along
			the bank and made use of the weak wifi at a restaurant to update the journal and check emails.
			There had been a recent flood. Mud caked the walkways and boat docks, and there were work crews
			out cleaning away debris. The delight of the morning was a large beaver swimming along side the
			bank. Nina chased it for about 1/2 a mile trying to get some photos. We have never seen a 
			beaver up close before and were surprised by its size.</p>
			<?php Skin::JournalGalleryThumbnails($trip, $entry); ?><p>Then onto the highway heading west through rolling fertile looking country in warm but windy
			weather. We arrived in St Louis late in the afternoon and could not resist parking on the
			banks of the Mississippi and went for a walk up to and into the <em>Gateway to the West Arch</em>.
			It truly is an impressive structure. We made a quick visit to the Lewis and Clark museum in the 
			base of the arch. It seems I have learned some more American history since I was last here as 
			much of the story seemed familiar. </p>
			<p>All in all a nice travel day.</p>
