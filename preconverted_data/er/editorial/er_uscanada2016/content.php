	    <p>As you all can see I am a bit late updating this section of our site. The Morocco stuff had been
		    there way too long and the fact that we are now traveling in Canada is obvious. So just to get up to date
		    we are on a slow tour of western Canada that should keep us occupied until November. We are quite excited about this 
	    plan as it will be our longest period of travel in the Earthroamer and will (we hope) take us to
	    many interesting places including (we plan) Churchill, Manitoba to see polar bears (
	    of course we fly the last leg from Winnipeg, no roads to Churchill).</p>
